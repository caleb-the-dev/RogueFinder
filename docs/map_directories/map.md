# RogueFinder — System Map

> High-level index of all game systems. Read this first each session, then navigate to the relevant bucket file.

## Map Metadata

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| last_updated | 2026-04-15 |
| last_groomed | 2026-04-15 |
| sessions_since_groom | 0 |
| groom_trigger | 10 |

> **Grooming rule:** When `sessions_since_groom` reaches `groom_trigger`, run a grooming pass:
> remove entries for deleted files, update descriptions that no longer match the code,
> prune stale "not here" notes, verify bucket file accuracy. Reset `sessions_since_groom` to 0.

## System Summaries

### Combat Manager
The central turn state machine. Owns all other scene nodes (builds them in `_ready()`). Routes player input, runs enemy AI, drives the ability targeting flow, applies effects, and decides win/lose conditions. Lives in `CombatScene3D.tscn`.

### Grid System
Tracks which cells are occupied, calculates move ranges, manages per-cell color highlights. Handles world↔grid coordinate math and mouse→cell raycasting.

### Unit System
Stateful game object: HP, energy, turn flags (`has_moved`, `has_acted`). Renders as a colored box mesh in 3D. Emits `unit_died` and `unit_moved` signals. Plays lunge/flash animations.

### QTE System
Standalone sliding-bar skill check. Displayed as a CanvasLayer overlay. Emits `qte_resolved(accuracy: float)` when resolved. Used for both player attacks and enemy attacks (enemy uses `qte_resolution` stat to simulate auto-accuracy).

### Camera System
DOS2-style isometric orbit camera. Supports Q/E 45° rotation, scroll zoom, and procedural camera shake (`trigger_shake()`). Built and owned by CombatManager3D.

### HUD System
CanvasLayer that displays HP and energy as ASCII bars for all 6 units. Duck-typed `refresh()` accepts both `Unit` (2D) and `Unit3D` arrays. Legacy 2D only.

### Stat Panel
CanvasLayer overlay (layer 8) opened on double-click of any unit. Shows the complete `CombatantData`. Scrollable. Closed by ✕ or ESC. Lives in `scripts/ui/StatPanel.gd`.

### Unit Info Bar
Condensed CanvasLayer strip (layer 4). Shown on single-click of any unit. Displays name, class, HP bar, energy bar, ATK/DEF/SPD. Hidden on deselect and combat end.

### Action Menu
CanvasLayer (layer 12) pop-up shown when a player unit is selected. D-pad layout: 4 ability buttons + 1 consumable center button. Projects the unit's 3D position to screen space. Emits `ability_selected(ability_id)` and `consumable_selected()`. Buttons grey out based on energy and `has_acted` state.

### Combatant Data Model
Two-file system: `CombatantData` (Resource) stores identity, core attributes, and slot data; all derived combat stats are computed properties. `ArchetypeLibrary` (static class) defines 5 archetypes and provides `create()` to instantiate randomized `CombatantData`.

### Ability Data Model
`AbilityData` (Resource) stores all fields for a single ability. `EffectData` (Resource) stores one effect within an ability. `TargetShape` enum: `SELF`, `SINGLE`, `CONE`, `LINE`, `RADIAL`. `EffectType` enum: `HARM`, `MEND`, `FORCE`, `TRAVEL`, `BUFF`, `DEBUFF`.

### Ability Library
`AbilityLibrary` (static class) defines 12 abilities and provides `get_ability(id) -> AbilityData`. Returns a safe stub for unknown IDs. Future CSV import will replace the inline dictionary without changing the API.

### Consumable Data Model
`ConsumableData` (Resource) stores id, name, effect_type, base_value, target_stat, and description for a single consumable. Only MEND, BUFF, and DEBUFF are valid effect types — consumables never HARM, FORCE, or TRAVEL.

### Consumable Library
`ConsumableLibrary` (static class) defines consumables and provides `get_consumable(id) -> ConsumableData`. Never returns null. Currently defines `healing_potion` (MEND 15 HP) and `power_tonic` (BUFF STR +2).

### Unit Data Resource (Legacy)
Superseded by `CombatantData` for the 3D system. Kept alive for `Unit.gd` (2D) and its test suite.

### Game State
Autoload singleton stub. Intended for run-wide data (party roster, items, map progress). Not yet wired to any system.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Input Handling
- Always use `_unhandled_input()` for world interaction — never `_input()`. This ensures GUI controls (StatPanel, ActionMenu) consume events before the world layer receives them.
- GUI nodes (CanvasLayer) take priority over 3D scene input automatically in Godot.

### Signal Naming
- All signals use past-tense event names: `unit_moved`, `qte_resolved`, `unit_died`.
- Systems signal *up* to CombatManager3D; CM3D never calls down into systems directly for event flow.

### Scene Building
- All `.tscn` files stay minimal (root node + script only). Children are built entirely in `_ready()`. No scene nesting of sub-scenes.

### Typed GDScript
- Always declare types: `var speed: int = 3`. No untyped vars.
- `snake_case` vars/funcs, `PascalCase` class/node names, `ALL_CAPS` constants.

### Testing
- Tests live in `/tests/`. Use `extends SceneTree`, `_initialize()`, plain `assert()`, `quit()`.
- Do NOT test: rendering, input, anything needing a live scene.
- Run headless: `godot --headless --path rogue-finder --import` first, then `godot --headless --path rogue-finder --script tests/<file>.gd`.
