# RogueFinder — Claude Session Context

> Drop this file at the start of every session. GAME_BIBLE is the design authority; this file is the build authority.

---

## Project Identity

- **Game:** RogueFinder — tactical turn-based roguelite / creature collector
- **Engine:** Godot 4 (GDScript)
- **Repo:** https://github.com/caleb-the-dev/RogueFinder
- **Docs:** https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/
- **Solo dev** — one programmer, one artist (pixel art + learning Blender)
- **Project layout:** The actual Godot project lives in `rogue-finder/`. All `res://` paths resolve there. Scripts under `rogue-finder/scripts/`, scenes under `rogue-finder/scenes/`, resources under `rogue-finder/resources/`. The repo root holds this doc, the bible, and `docs/`.

## Current Build State

- **Stage:** Stage 1.5 — 3D combat prototype + traversable world map
- **Entry point:** `main.tscn` → MapScene (game boots into the map, not combat)
- **Live systems:** 3D combat loop · traversable world map with 6 node types · save/load · reward system · Badurga city shell (placeholder sections) · threat escalation counter + HUD bar
- **Last session (S16):** Persistent Party Slice 1 — data foundation. Added `ability_pool: Array[String]`, `current_hp: int`, `current_energy: int`, `is_dead: bool` to `CombatantData`. `ArchetypeLibrary.create()` seeds all four (pool from archetype abilities, no empty strings; hp/energy to max). No save/load yet — deferred to Slice 2. 5 new headless tests, all 22 passing.
- **Deferred:** Badurga section content (all 6 buttons are stubs), Recruit/Vendor/Event scene content (NodeStub placeholder), per-ability QTE styles, ability effects are placeholder, boss difficulty scaling from threat quadrants (Feature 8), Persistent Party Slice 2 (save/load wire-up for new CombatantData fields), Slice 3 (CombatManager3D tracks current_hp/energy between combats)

For current feature-by-feature status and history, read `docs/map_directories/map.md` and the bucket files it links. For planned work, read `docs/backlog.md` (only when asked).

## Code Conventions

- **Typed GDScript** — always declare types (`var speed: int = 3`)
- `snake_case` vars/funcs, `PascalCase` class/node names, `ALL_CAPS` constants
- One script per scene; prefer **signals** over direct calls
- `@export` for inspector-tweakable values; `@onready` for node refs
- **Placeholder art:** Use the Godot icon (`load("res://icon.svg")`) as the default for all 2D placeholder artwork (portraits, ability icons, item icons). Replace with real art when assets arrive.
- Section headers: `## --- Section Name ---`; comment the *why*, not the *what*
- All `.tscn` files stay **minimal** (root + script only) — build children in `_ready()`
- Signals named as past-tense events: `unit_moved`, `qte_resolved`

---

## Key Design Rules (do not deviate)

- **3v3 combat** — 3 player units vs 3 enemies units
- **Team-based initiative** — all players act, then all enemies
- **Action economy per turn:** Stride (free) + Active Action/Ability (costs Energy) + Consumable (if combatant has one)
- **QTE:** example: sliding bar — hit accuracy × stat delta = damage
- **Enemy AI:** hidden `qte_resolution` stat (grunt 0.3, elite 0.8)

---

## Testing Approach

Write implementation + tests in one response. Tests go in `/tests/`. Use plain `assert()` — no scene required.

Test: state transitions, damage formula, grid math, win/lose triggers.
Do NOT test: rendering, input, anything needing a live scene.

---

## Teaching Mode

- Comment non-obvious logic; note structural decisions (why a signal, etc.)
- Explain in plain terms when asked — dev knows GML/SQL, learning GDScript
- Do NOT explain things not asked about
- Ask the user for permission before triggering anything from the superpowers plugin.

---

## Version Control Workflow

- Every session, create and push a branch named `claude/<feature>-<YYYYMMDD>` before any work.
- **Never touch `main`** until the user explicitly approves the branch.
- When work is ready, commit + push, then tell the user:
  ```
  Branch ready: claude/<feature>-<YYYYMMDD>
  Open Godot from C:\Users\caleb\.local\bin\Projects\RogueFinder\ to test. Tell me to merge when you're happy.
  ```
- On approval: `git checkout main && git merge <branch> --no-ff && git push origin main`.
- If the user rejects, keep iterating on the same branch.

---

## Documentation Protocol

- **`docs/map_directories/map.md`** is the high-level index of all game systems. Read it first when working on an unfamiliar system, then navigate to the relevant bucket file. Only read what you need.
- After any significant logic change or new system, update the relevant bucket `.md` files — changed/new signals, public methods, dependencies, structural decisions. If a change crosses systems, update both bucket files plus `map.md`.
- Do not use this `CLAUDE.md` for workflow scratchwork, placeholders, or session history.
- **`/wrapup`** is the authoritative end-of-session workflow (lives at `~/.claude/skills/wrapup/SKILL.md`). Do not do wrap-up work outside it.

## Save System

Save/load is live. Pattern: add a field to `GameState`, include it in `save()`'s data dict, read it back in `load_save()` (use `Array(..., TYPE_T, "", null)` for typed arrays). Save file: `user://save.json`.

**Every new feature that introduces persistent run state must extend the save system.** Ask: "does this data need to survive a session?" If yes, wire `save()`/`load_save()` in the same PR — do not defer.

Currently saved: `player_node_id`, `visited_nodes`, `map_seed`, `node_types`, `cleared_nodes`, `threat_level`.
Not yet saved (Stage 2): party roster, inventory, faction reputation, combat state.
Transient (never saved): `pending_node_type`, `current_combat_node_id` — consumed within a single scene transition.
